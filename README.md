BN-NAS: Neural Architecture Search with Batch Normalization
=========================================
Code for [BN-NAS: Neural Architecture Search with Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07375) accepted by ICCV2021


2021.12.2 update: Since the original experiments are based on a private framework which cannot be released, we are re-implementing the code based on [ABS](https://github.com/megvii-model/AngleNAS) and [SPOS](https://github.com/megvii-model/SinglePathOneShot). We plan to release the code before the end of the 2021. 
Thanks for your patience!
